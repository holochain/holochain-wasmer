/// This macro is the recommended way of returning an error from a Zome function.
///
/// If a single expression is passed to `wasm_error!` the result will be converted
/// to a `WasmErrorInner` via `into()` so string and `WasmErrorInner` values are
/// both supported directly.

/// to `format!` and then the resultant string converted to `WasmErrorInner`.

/// As the string->WasmErrorInner conversion is handled by a call to into, the
/// feature `error_as_host` can be used so that `WasmErrorInner::Host` is produced
/// by the macro from any passed/generated string.

///
/// ```ignore
/// Err(wasm_error!(WasmErrorInner::Guest("entry not found".to_string())));
/// Err(wasm_error!("entry not found"));
/// Err(wasm_error!("{} {}", "entry", "not found"));
